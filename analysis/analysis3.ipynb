    "What interests me most about this data is whether these high grossing movies are any better than less popular films. Going into this topic, I will admit that I am somewhat biased as I've seen dozens of films not contained in this dataset which I've rated an 8 out of 10 or higher. That being said, I will be fair and let the data speak for itself. I will be using a dataset of my own creation to examine the ratings of each of these films on Imdb, letterboxd, rottentomatoes, and rateyourmusic.\n",
