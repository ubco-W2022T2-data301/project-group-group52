    "## Research question/interests\n",
    "\n",
    "What interests me most about this data is whether these high grossing movies are any better than less popular films. Going into this topic, I will admit that I am somewhat biased as I've seen dozens of films not contained in this dataset which I've rated an 8 out of 10 or higher. That being said, I will be fair and let the data speak for itself. I will be using a dataset of my own creation to examine the ratings of each of these films on Imdb, letterboxd, rottentomatoes, and rateyourmusic. If I have time, I would also like to compare and contrast my own ratings of some of these films to their aggregate ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "My research questions will be thus: **\"Is there any relationship between the quality of a movie and its popularity? Also, is there any significant relationship between a movie's release year and its quality?\"** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this research question, I will be using 3 different aggregate rating scores from 3 different locations. These locations are as follows:\n",
    " - Imdb weighted average rating out of 10\n",
    " - Letterboxd weighted average rating out of 5 stars\n",
    " - RateYourMusic weighted average rating out of 5 stars\n",
    " \n",
    "Credits go to:\n",
    " - [Sonemic](\"Sonemic.com\") for the RateYourMusic data\n",
    " - [IMDb](\"Imdb.com\") for the IMDb data\n",
    " - [Letterboxd](\"Letterboxd.com\") for the Letterboxd data\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are these ratings aggregated?\n",
    "In order to properly understand my analysis, it is important that we understand how each of these sites aggregates their ratings because they have significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imdb\n",
    "Imdb uses a simple weighted average system to give movies a score out of 10 rounded to one decimal place. Not every rating is equal on Imdb. According to the website, when users with unusual voting activity are detected, their rating is given a lesser weight to the overall score. This is to prevent 'review-bombing' or abuse of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Letterboxd\n",
    "Letterboxd uses a similar system to Imdb, except that it has a 10 point scale where you can rate things from 0.5 stars to 5 stars. Also, one other key difference is that Letterboxd attempts to account for low sample size by weighting down films with low numbers of ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RateYourMusic (films)\n",
    "RateYourMusic (aka RYM) uses a weighted average system which rewards users who actively participate on the website. The rating scale is a 5 star system, but a 10 point scale, like Letterboxd. Again, not all ratings equally contribute to the final score. Users who sign up and leave a few ratings on the website are weighted less (~0.5) than users who actively participate (~1). Users who abuse the system are given a near-zero weighting (~0). One interesting caveat of RYM is that they actually give a small bonus to someone's weighting if they not only rate a movie, but also leave a review (~1.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What assumptions will I make?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I will be converting every aggregate score to a rating out of 10, rounded to 2 decimal places. I will follow RottenTomatoes' audience score assumption and assume that an 'average' movie is one that is a 6/10. This seems to be reasonable as the other 3 websites have a minimum rating of 1/10 or 0.5/5 with a maximum rating of 10 or 5, implying an arithemetic mean of 6/10 or 3/5. To account for uncertainty and inaccuracies in ratings, as well as differences in the subjective rating scales of individual moviegoers, I will expand the definition of an 'average' movie to be any movie rated between 5.50 and 6.49 inclusive. Any movie rated 6.50 or above will be considered 'good', whereas any movie rated 5.49 or below will be considered 'bad'. Amongst the 'good' movies, I will make the further distinction that a movie rated 8.00 or higher is 'great'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary\n",
    "\n",
    " - 0 - 5.49 = Bad\n",
    " - 5.50 - 6.49 = Average\n",
    " - 6.50 - 10.00 = Good\n",
    "    - 8.00 - 10.00 = Great\n",
    "\n",
    "### How will I conduct this analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first analyze the rating data by using a weighted average of all 5 ratings sources, then I will do an individual analysis of the scores for each website. I expect the initial analysis will give a solid holistic view of the overall movie quality, whereas the individual analysis will help explain variation in ratings from different sites.\n",

Note however that there tend to be fewer data points as you go further away from the current year. This is probably due in large part because the original dataset for high grossing movies is not inflation-adjusted. This results in a higher representation of newer movies. It may very well be the case that we only see this downward trend because only the better movies from older decades accrued enough nominal revenue to be represented in this dataset. It would be interesting to see whether this trend still exists if this dataset was adjusted for inflation."
