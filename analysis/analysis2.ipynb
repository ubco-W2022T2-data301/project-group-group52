    "I will answer the question, **\"Are shorter or longer films more popular?\"** In terms of the dataset, I will be analyzing whether there is any significant correlation between the runtimes and the rankings or sales (domestic, international, and global) of the included films. I will also look into whether runtimes correlate with the genres or distributors of the films, in case these are acting as confounding variables. Before running any analysis, I will ensure that runtimnes are available for all or the majority of the films, and I will manually add data based on my own research where necessary. Once these statistical analyses are complete, I will begin analyzing my results to build hypotheses to explain the patterns or lack there of observed. I plan on looking into studies on human attention span to see if psychological findings support my own results."
