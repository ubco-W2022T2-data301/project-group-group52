## Vision Statement
"To reach the summit of quality movies". In this project we will to examine metrics and characteristics of popular Hollywood movies in an attempt to understand what makes a commercially successful movie. With this aim in mind, we want to answer or at least gain a deeper understanding of three core questions:
1. Do certain marketing characteristics (title keywords, runtime, release date) correlate with popularity and thus higher returns?
2. Do genres matter? Why? Are there significant differences in the genres domestic audiences prefer as opposed to international audiences?
3. Does popularity translate to quality? If so, to what degree?
