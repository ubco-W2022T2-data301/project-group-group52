   The second question our project addressed was: "Does the length of a film affect its popularity, as assessed by sales and ratings?" In order to answer this question, our main dataset - which provided domestic, international, and worldwide sales for each film - was supplemented by our own dataset containing ratings for each film. This dataset was filled manually and pulled ratings from three sites - IMDb, Letterboxd, and Rate Your Music. The ratings from these sites were standardized to percentages and averaged to calculate the average rating for each film. The worldwide popularity of each film was then calculated based on worldwide sales and average rating, as the following equation describes: (0.5)(world sales/maximum world sales) + (0.5)(average rating).
   Linear regressions were performed on the following pairs of variables: domestic sales vs. runtime, international sales vs. runtime, world sales vs. runtime, average rating vs. runtime, and worldwide popularity vs. runtime. To ensure the data fulfilled the assumptions for linear regression, residual plots were graphed for each variable pairing. Where heteroscedasticity was observed, the independent variable was log-base-2-transformed. This log-transformation successfully solved all cases of heteroscedasticity. There were some cases where further data manipulation was required, such as removal of major outliers. Linear regression found significant positive correlations between all variable pairings.
