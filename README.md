## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We chose this topic because we all share a connection to and enthusiasm about movies. We chose this specific dataset because the range of variables included provides multiple avenues for research. Some of us are particularly interested in the monetary aspect of movies and comparing this among different genres, for example. We hope to find some sort of pattern in what makes a movie popular and why that is. The dataset provides a lot of information that we can use to find that pattern. All of us have many questions that we wish to answer, such as, "What genres are popular domestically and internationally, and why?" and "Are shorter or longer movies more popular?"

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we chose is about the the top 1000 highest-grossing Hollywood films. It was published on *Kaggle* by user Sanjeet Singh Naik but has been contributed to by other users over the years, with a current number of 21 unique contributors. The dataset contains information pertaining to multiple aspects of each top-ranking movie, including its rank, name, synopsis, distributor, release date, domestic sales (in USD), international sales (in USD), world sales (in USD), genre, and runtime. The dataset provides an extensive list of the highest grossing movies dating all the way from March 15, 1972 to January 10, 2022 (the date on which the dataset was last updated). Although the title under which the dataset was published describes it as the "top 1000," the dataset, in actuality, only contains 918 movie titles. The data was collected from various websites that specialize in the ratings of movies; the description on Kaggle specifically referenced the use of the sites *IMDb* and *Rotten Tomatoes*.
