## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We chose this particular topic because all of us are interested in movies and find movies itself interesting. We chose this specific dataset because we feel that there are multiple avenues we can take, but some of us are particularly interested in the monetary aspect of the movies and comparing that with different genres of movies for example. We hope to find some sort of pattern in what makes a movie popular and why that happens. The dataset provides a lot of information that we can use to find that pattern. All of us have many questions that we wish to answer, but one of them for example is What genres are popular domestically and internationally, and why?.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we chose is about the the top 1000 highest grossing movies. The dataset has no one author as it has been contributed to by many people over the years, till no there have been 21 unique contributors to the dataset. The dataset we chose provides us with data pertaining to multiple aspects of a movie, it provides the rank of the movie, name, synopsis, distributor, release date, domestic sales (in USD), international sales (in USD), world sales (in USD), genre, and the runtime of the movie. The dataset provides an extensive list of the highest grossing movies all the way from 15th March 1972 to 10th January 2022. The data has been collected from various websites that specialize in the ratings of movies, it has been acknowledged by the contributors that the data has been gathered from sites like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.
